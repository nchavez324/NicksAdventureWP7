3D RPG for WP7

A game I made learning 3D graphics with Microsoft's XNA Game library. I learned C# (thankfully it's almost
identical to Java..) and how to read library documentation and technical guides. I started this over the Fall
of 2012, running it on my Windows Phone. I learned a lot about 3D graphics, rendering, and computer graphics in
general. I delved into some scripting and learned a lot about mobile app development. I also made a Windows 8 app
that was a map editor for the game.

The game contains two very simple maps that contain interactive NPCs and buildings with doors. The controls
are a touch-D-pad and touch A and B buttons on the phone/simulator. It's actually quite interesting and cute
but I don't think I'm going to continue working on this one.

Most of the image assets aren't mine (they're very Pokemonish...) but the 3D models are.

The project was done in Visual Studio 2012, with C#/XNA.
